# Le Scone 🥐🥪

This project is a landing page of a fictional restaurant called Le Scone and was developed to put into practice the knowledge acquired during the "CSS with SASS" Course from [Origamid](https://www.origamid.com/), a Brazilian learning platform.

The page is responsive and contains three main sections and a footer:

- Hero: contains the logo, the page's main image, and information about the restaurant's opening hours and location
- Menu: menu of the food served in the restaurant, with prices and images
- Contact: contact form and embedded google maps
